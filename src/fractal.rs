//! Types for generating noise related to fractal patterns.
//!
//! These are the main coherent noise implementations. PinkNoise and BillowNoise
//! in particular can be traced back to ideas used by Ken Perlin in
//! [Tron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron), and later demonstrated when he
//! introduced the first "noise" function to industry in 1985 (where they were
//! used to create cloud and fire textures, respectively).

///
/// $$M(\mathbf{x}) = p N(f \mathbf{x}) + p\^2 N(fl \mathbf{x}) + \ldots +
///     p\^n N(fl\^{n - 1} \mathbf{x})$$

/// where $p, f, l$ are persistence, frequency, and lacunarity, respectively,
/// $N$ is the noise function, and $\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of input
